=== SAML Clients

{project_name} supports <<_saml,SAML 2.0>> for registered applications.
POST and Redirect bindings are supported. You can choose to require client signature validation. You can have the server sign and/or encrypt responses as well.

.Procedure
. Click `Clients` in the left navigation pane.  

. Click *Create* to go to the `Add Client` page.
+
.Add Client
image:{project_images}/add-client-saml.png[]

. Enter the `Client ID` of the client. This is often a URL and is the expected `issuer` value in SAML requests sent by the application.

. Select `saml` in the `Client Protocol` drop down box.

. Enter the `Client SAML Endpoint` URL. This URL is where you want the {project_name} server to send SAML requests and responses. Generally, applications have one URL for processing SAML requests. Multiple URLs can be set in the `Settings` tab of the client.

. Click *Save*.  This action creates the client and brings you to the `Settings` tab.

.Client Settings

+
The following list describes each setting:
+
`Client ID`:: The alpha-numeric ID string that is used in OIDC requests and in the {project_name} database to identify the client. This value must match the issuer value sent with AuthNRequests. {project_name} pulls the issuer from the Authn SAML request and match it to a client by this value.

`Name`:: The name for the client in {project_name} UI screen. To localize
the name, set up a replacement string value. For example, a string value such as $\{myapp}.  See the link:{developerguide_link}[{developerguide_name}] for more information.

`Description`:: The description of the client.  This setting can also be localized.

`Enabled`:: When set to OFF, the client cannot request authentication.

`Consent Required`:: When set to ON, users see a consent page that they can use to grant access to that application.  It will also display metadata so the user knows the exact information that the client can access.

`Include AuthnStatement`:: SAML login responses may specify the authentication method used (password, etc.) as well as timestamps of the login and the session expiration.
This is enabled by default, which means that `AuthnStatement` element will be included in login responses. Setting this to off prevents clients from determining the maximum session length, which can create  client sessions that do not expire.

`Sign Documents`:: When set to ON, {project_name} sign the document using the realms private key.

`Optimize REDIRECT signing key lookup`:: When set to ON, the SAML protocol messages will include the {project_name} native extension. This extension contains a hint with the signing key ID. The SAML Protocol use the extension for signature validation instead of attempting to validate the signature using keys. 

This option applies to REDIRECT bindings where the signature is transferred in query parameters and there this information is not in any signature information. This is contrary to POST binding messages where key ID is always included in document signature. 

This option is used where IDP and SAML Protocol are provided by the {project_name} server and adapter. This option is only relevant when `Sign Documents` is set to ON.

`Sign Assertions`:: The assertion is signed and embedded within the SAML XML Auth response.

`Signature Algorithm`:: Algorithm selection for signing SAML documents.

`SAML Signature Key Name`:: Signed SAML documents sent using POST binding contain identification of the signing key in the `KeyName` element. This contains the {project_name} key ID by default. This option controls if `KeyName` contains key ID (option `KEY_ID`), subject from certificate corresponding to the realm key (option `CERT_SUBJECT` - expected for instance by Microsoft Active Directory Federation  Services), or that the key name hint is completely omitted from the SAML message (option `NONE`).

Canonicalization Method::
  Canonicalization method for XML signatures.

Encrypt Assertions::
  Encrypt assertions in SAML documents with the realm's private key.
  The AES algorithm is used with a key size of 128 bits. 

Client Signature Required::
  Expect that documents coming from a client are signed.
  {project_name} will validate this signature using the client public key or cert set up in the `SAML Keys` tab.

Force POST Binding::
  By default, {project_name} will respond using the initial SAML binding of the original request.
  By turning on this switch, you will force {project_name} to always respond using the SAML POST Binding even if the original request was the Redirect binding.

Front Channel Logout::
  If true, this application requires a browser redirect to be able to perform a logout.
  For example, the application may require a cookie to be reset which could only be done via a redirect.
  If this switch is false, then {project_name} will invoke a background SAML request to logout the application.

Force Name ID Format::
  If the request has a name ID policy, ignore it and used the value configured in the admin console under Name ID Format 

Name ID Format::
  Name ID Format for the subject.
  If no name ID policy is specified in the request or if the Force Name ID Format attribute is true, this value is used.
  Properties used for each of the respective formats are defined below. 

Root URL::
  If {project_name} uses any configured relative URLs, this value is prepended to them.

Valid Redirect URIs::
  This is an optional field.  Enter in a URL pattern and click the + sign to add.  Click the - sign next to URLs you want to remove.
  Remember that you still have to click the `Save` button!
  Wildcards (*) are only allowed at the end of a URI, i.e. $$http://host.com/*$$.  This field is used when the exact SAML
  endpoints are not registered and {project_name} is pulling the Assertion Consumer URL from the request.

Base URL::
  If {project_name} needs to link to the client, this URL would be used.

Master SAML Processing URL::
  This URL will be used for all SAML requests and the response will be directed to the SP.
  It will be used as the Assertion Consumer Service URL and the Single Logout Service URL.
  If a login request contains the Assertion Consumer Service URL, that will take precedence, but this URL must be validated by a registered Valid Redirect URI pattern 

Assertion Consumer Service POST Binding URL::
  POST Binding URL for the Assertion Consumer Service. 

Assertion Consumer Service Redirect Binding URL::
  Redirect Binding URL for the Assertion Consumer Service. 

Logout Service POST Binding URL::
  POST Binding URL for the Logout Service. 

Logout Service Redirect Binding URL::
  Redirect Binding URL for the Logout Service.
