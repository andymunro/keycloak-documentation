=== Dedicated Realm Admin Consoles

Each realm has an Admin Console. Access the admin console by going to the `/auth/admin/{realm-name}/console` url. Users within that realm can get realm management permissions by assigning specific user role mappings.

Each realm has a client named `realm-management`. You can view this client in the `Clients` menu in your realm. The client defines client-level roles that specify permissions for management of the realm.

* view-realm
* view-users
* view-clients
* view-events
* manage-realm
* manage-users
* create-client
* manage-clients
* manage-events
* view-identity-providers
* manage-identity-providers
* impersonation

Users with these roles can use that specific part of the administration console only.
