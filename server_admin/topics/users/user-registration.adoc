You can use {project_name} as a third-party authorization server to manage application users. Administrators can add users or users can register themselves.

You can enable {project_name} to allow user self registration. When enabled, the login page displays a registration link that the user can click to create a new account.

When user self-registration is enabled, it is possible to use the registration form to detect valid usernames and emails.
