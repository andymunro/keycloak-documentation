= User Registration

[role="_abstract"]
You can use {project_name} as a third-party authorization server to manage application users. Administrators can add users or users can register themselves.

You can enable {project_name} to allow user self-registration. When enabled, the login page displays a registration link that the user can click to create an account.

When user self-registration is enabled, the user must complete a form to add profile information. 

The registration form can be customized by removing or adding additional fields that must be completed by a user. It is possible to use the registration form to detect a valid username and email.
