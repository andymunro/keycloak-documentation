= User Credentials

When viewing a user if you go to the `Credentials` tab you can manage a user's credentials.

.Credential Management
image:{project_images}/user-credentials.png[]

The credentials are listed in a table, which has the following fields:

Position::
   The arrow buttons in this column allows you to shift the priority of the credential for the user, with the topmost credential having the highest priority.
   This priority determines which credential will be shown first to a user in case of a choice during login. The highest priority of those available to the
   user will be the one selected.
Type::
   This shows the type of the credential, for example `password` or `otp`.
User Label::
   This is an assignable label to recognise the credential when presented as a selection option during login. It can be set to any value to describe the
   credential.
Data::
   This shows the non-confidential technical information about the credential. It is originally hidden, but you can press `Show data...` to reveal it for a
   credential.
Actions::
   This column has two buttons. `Save` records the value of the User Label, while `Delete` will remove the credential.


==== Creating other credentials

You cannot configure other types of credentials for a specific user within the Admin Console. This is the responsibility of the user.

You can only delete credentials for a user on the `Credentials` tab, for example if the user has lost an OTP device, or if a credential has been compromised.
