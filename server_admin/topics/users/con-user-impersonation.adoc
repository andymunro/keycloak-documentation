[id="con-user-impersonation_{context}"]
= User Impersonation

An admin can impersonate a user.  For example, a user may be experiencing a bug in an applications and an admin can impersonate the user to investigate or duplicate the problem. Admins with the appropriate permission can impersonate a user. 

Any user with the `impersonation` role in the realm can impersonate a user.

* If the admin and the user are in the same realm, then the admin will be logged out and automatically logged in as the user being impersonated.  
* If the admin and user are not in the same realm, the admin will remain logged in, and additionally will be logged in as the user in that user's realm.  

In both cases, the browser will be redirected to the impersonated user's *User Account Management* page. 

There are two locations an admin can access the *Impersonate* button to initiate user impersonation. You can access the *Impersonate* button from the *Details* tab or from the *Users* list.
