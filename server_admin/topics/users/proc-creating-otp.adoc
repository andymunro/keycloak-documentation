= Creating an OTP

If OTP is conditional in your realm, the user will have to go to the User Account Management service to re-configure a new
OTP generator. If OTP is required, then the user will be asked
to re-configure a new OTP generator when they log in.

Like passwords, you can alternatively send an email to the user that will ask them to reset their OTP generator.  Choose
`Configure OTP` in the `Reset Actions` list box and click the `Send Email` button.  The sent email
contains a link that will bring the user to the OTP setup screen. You can use this method even if the user already has an OTP credential,
and would like to set up some more.
