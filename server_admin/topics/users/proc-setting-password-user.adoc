= Setting a Password for the User

If a user doesn't have a password, or if the password has been deleted, the `Set Password` section will be shown on the page.

.Credential Management - Set Password

To create a password for a user, type in a new one. Click on the `Set Password` button after you've typed everything in.
If the `Temporary` switch is on, this new password can only be used once and the user will be asked to change their password after they have
logged in.

If a user already has a password, it can be reset in the `Reset Password` section.

Alternatively, if you have <<_email, email>> set up, you can send an email to the user that asks
them to reset their password.  Choose `Update Password` from the `Reset Actions` list box and click `Send Email`. You can optionally
set the validity of the e-mail link which defaults to the one preset in `Tokens` tab in the realm settings.
The sent email contains a link that will bring the user to the update password screen.

Note that a user can only have a single credential of type password.
