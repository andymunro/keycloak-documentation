=== Admin Events

The Admin Console performs its functions by invoking the {project_name} REST interface. Because {project_name} audits all REST invocations, {project_name} can record all administrator actions within the Admin Console. You can view the action events in the Admin Console.

To enable auditing of Admin actions:

.Procedure
. Click the *Events* menu.
. Click the *Config* tab.

.Event Configuration

. Toggle the *Save Events* switch to *ON* in the `Admin Events Settings` section. {project_name} displays the *Include Representation* switch.

+
. Toggle the *Include Representation* switch to *ON*.

The `Include Representation` switch includes JSON documents sent through the admin REST API so you can view the administrators actions. To clear the database of stored actions, click the *Clear admin events* button.

To view the admin events, click the *Admin Events* tab.
