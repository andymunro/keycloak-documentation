=== Composite Roles

Any realm or client level role can be a _composite role_. A _composite role_ is a role that has one or more additional roles associated with it. When a composite role is mapped to a user, the user also gains the roles associated with that composite.  This inheritance is recursive so any composite of composites also gets inherited.

To convert a regular role to a composite role:
. Click the `Roles` left menu item.
. Click the role to access the roles detail page.
. Set the `Composite Role` switch to ON.

The role selection UI is displayed on the page and you can associate realm level and client level roles to the composite you are creating.

In this example, the `employee` realm-level role is associated with the `developer` composite role.  Any user with the `developer` role inherits the `employee` role too.

[NOTE]
====
When creating tokens and SAML assertions, any composite also has its associated roles added to the claims and assertions of the authentication response sent back to the client.
