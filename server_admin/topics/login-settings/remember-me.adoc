=== Remember Me

A logged-in user closing their browser destroys their session, and they must log in again. You can set {project_name} to keep the user's login session open if they click the _Remember Me_ checkbox when they log in. This action turns the login cookie from a session-only cookie to a persistence cookie.

.Procedure
. Click *Realm Settings* in the menu.
. Click the *Login* tab.
