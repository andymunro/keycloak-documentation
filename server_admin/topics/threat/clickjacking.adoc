=== Clickjacking

Clickjacking is a technique of tricking users into clicking on a user interface element different from what users perceive. A malicious site loads the target site in a transparent iFrame, overlaid on top of a set of dummy buttons placed directly under important buttons on the target site. When a user clicks a visible button, they are clicking a button on the hidden page. An attacker can steal a user's authentication credentials and access their resources by using this method.

By default, every response by {project_name} sets the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034[X-FRAME_OPTIONS] and http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/[Content-Security-Policy] browser headers to prevent clickjacking. See the documentation for these headers for details on fine-grain browser access. 

.Procedure
In the Admin Console, you can specify the values of the X-FRAME_OPTIONS and Content-Security-Policy headers. 

. Click the *Realm Settings* menu item.
. Click the *Security Defenses* tab.
