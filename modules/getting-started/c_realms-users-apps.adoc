= Realms, users, and applications
When you log in to the Admin Console, you work in a realm, which is a space where you manage objects. Two types of realms exist:

* The master realm - This realm was created for you when you first started {project_name}. It contains the admin account you created at the first login.

* Other realms - These realms are created by the admin in the master realm. You can use these realms to create users and applications. The applications are owned by the users.
