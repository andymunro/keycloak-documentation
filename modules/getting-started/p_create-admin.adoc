= Creating the admin account

After the server starts, you are ready to create the admin account.

.Procedure

. Open http://localhost:8080/auth in your web browser. The welcome page will indicate that the server is running.

. Enter a username and password to create an initial admin user. 

You use this account to log in to the `master` realm's Admin Console and create realms. In these other realms, you add users and register applications to be secured by {project_name}.
