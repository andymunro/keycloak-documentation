=== Installation using a Keycloak custom resource 

You can use the Operator to automate the installation of {project_name} as defined by a Keycloak custom resource. By installing {project_name} using a custom resource, you create the components and services that are described here and illustrated in the graphic that follows.

* `keycloak-db-secret` - Stores properties such as the database username, password, and external address (if you connect to an external database)
* `credentials-<CR-Name>` - Admin username and password to log into the {project_name} admin console (the credential-<CR Name> is based on the Keycloak custom resource name)
* `keycloak` - Keycloak deployment specification that is implemented as a StatefulSet and with high availability support
* `keycloak-postgresql` - Starts a PostgreSQL database installation
* `keycloak-discovery` Service - Performs `JDBC_PING` discovery
* `keycloak` Service - Connects to {project_name} through HTTPS (HTTP is not supported)
* `keycloak-postgresql` Service - Connects an internal and external, if used, database instance
* `keycloak` Route - The URL for accessing the {project_name} admin console from OpenShift
ifeval::[{project_community}==true]
* `keycloak` Ingress - The URL for accessing the {project_name} admin console from Kubernetes
endif::[]

==== Keycloak custom resource

You can use the Operator to manage {project_name} clusters by creating a Keycloak custom resource, which is defined in a YAML file.

[NOTE]
You can update the YAML file and the changes appear in the {project_name} admin console, however changes to the admin console do not update the custom resource.

The `Keycloak` YAML file contains three properties. 

* `instances` - controls the number of instances running in high availability mode.
* `externalAccess` - if the `enabled` is `True`, the Operator creates a route for OpenShift
ifeval::[{project_community}==true]
 or an Ingress for Kubernetes
endif::[]
 for the {project_name} cluster.
* `externalDatabase` - applies only if you want to connect an externally hosted database. That topic is covered in the <<_external_database,external database>> section of this guide.

.Example YAML file for a Keycloak custom resource
```yaml
apiVersion: keycloak.org/v1alpha1
kind: Keycloak
metadata:
  name: keycloak
  labels:
    app: sso
spec:
  instances: 1
  externalAccess:
    enabled: True
```

ifeval::[{project_community}==true]
=== Creating a Keycloak custom resource on Kubernetes

On Kubernetes, you create an ingress, which is the IP address of the admin console, and find the secret, which holds the user name and password for that console.

.Prerequisites

You have a YAML file for this custom resource.

.Procedure 

. Create the ingress using your YAML file. `oc create -f <filename>.yaml -n <namespace>`.  For example:
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
$ oc create -f keycloak.yaml -n keycloak
westover.org/keycloak created
----
+
This command creates an ingress on Kubernetes.

. Find the ingress: `oc get ingress -n <cr_name>`. For example:
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
$ oc get ingress -n keycloak
NAME       HOSTS                 ADDRESS     PORTS   AGE
keycloak   keycloak.redhat.com   192.0.2.0   80      3m
----

. Copy and paste the ADDRESS (the ingress) into a web browser.
+
The {project_name} admin console login screen appears.
+
.{project_name} admin console login screen
image:images/login-empty.png[]

. Locate the user name and password.
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
$ oc get secret credentials-<CR-Name> -o go-template='{{range $k,$v := .data}}{{printf "%s: " $k}}{{if not $v}}{{$v}}{{else}}{{$v | base64decode}}{{end}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}'
----

. Copy and paste the user name and password into the admin console login screen.
+
.{project_name} admin console login screen
image:images/login-complete.png[]
+
You are now logged into an instance of {project_name} that was installed by a Keycloak custom resource.
+
.Admin console master realm
image:images/new_install_cr.png[]

. Check the status of the custom resource.

[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
$ oc describe keycloak <cr_name>
----

endif::[]
==== Creating a Keycloak custom resource on OpenShift

On OpenShift, you create a route, which is the URL of the admin console, and find the secret, which holds the user name and password for the admin console.

.Prerequisites

You have a YAML file for this custom resource.

.Procedure 

. Create a route using your YAML file. `oc create -f <filename>.yaml -n <namespace>`. For example:
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
ifeval::[{project_community}==true]
$ oc create -f keycloak.yaml -n keycloak
westover.org/keycloak created
endif::[]
ifeval::[{project_product}==true]
$ oc create -f sso.yaml -n sso
westover.org/sso created
endif::[]
----
+
A route is created in OpenShift.

. Check that the {project_name} container is ready.
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
$ oc describe keycloak <cr_name>
----

. Log into the OpenShift web console.

. Select `Networking`, `Route` and search for Keycloak. 
+
.Routes screen in OpenShift web console
image:images/route-ocp.png[]

. On the screen with the Keycloak route, click the URL under `Location`.
+
The {project_name} admin console login screen appears.
+
.{project_name} admin console login screen
image:images/login-empty.png[]

. Locate the user name and password for the admin console in the OpenShift web console; under `Workloads`, click `Secrets` and search for Keycloak.
+
.Secrets screen in OpenShift web console
image:images/secrets-ocp.png[]

. Copy and paste the user name and password into the admin console login screen.
+
.{project_name} admin console login screen
image:images/login-complete.png[]
+
You are now logged into an instance of {project_name} that was installed by a Keycloak custom resource.
+
.{project_name} master realm
image:images/new_install_cr.png[]

.Results

After the Operator processes the custom resource, view the status with this command:

[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
$ oc describe keycloak <cr_name>
----
