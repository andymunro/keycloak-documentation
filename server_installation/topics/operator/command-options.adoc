=== Command options for managing custom resources

After you create a custom request, you can edit it or delete using the `oc` command.

* To edit a custom request, use this command: `oc edit <cr-name>`
* To delete a custom request, use this command: `oc delete <cr-name>`

For example, to edit a realm custom request named `test-realm`, used this command:

[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
$ oc edit test-realm
----

A window appears where you can make changes. For example, you might change the name `arealm` to `demo-realm`.

[NOTE]
You can update the YAML file and changes appear in the {project_name} admin console, however changes to the admin console do not update the custom resource.
