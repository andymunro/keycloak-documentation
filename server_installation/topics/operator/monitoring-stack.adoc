=== Viewing performance metrics

The {project_operator} integrates with the {application_monitoring_operator}, which provides access to the Grafana Dashboard and Prometheus Alerts. You can view metrics such as the number of controller runtime reconciliation loops, the reconcile loop time, and errors.

The integration is seamless and requires no action to be set up. You do not need to configure integration with Grafana, but you must install the {application_monitoring_operator} in the cluster.

.Prerequisite

The {project_operator} is installed.

.Procedure

. Install the {application_monitoring_operator} using the link:{application_monitoring_operator_installation_link}[documentation].

. Annotate the namespace used for the {project_operator} installation. For example:
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
oc label namespace <namespace> monitoring-key=middleware
----

. Confirm monitoring is working by searching for Prometheus and Grafana route in `application-monitoring` namespace:
