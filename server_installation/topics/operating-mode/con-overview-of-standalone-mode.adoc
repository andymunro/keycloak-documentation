= Overview of standalone mode

Use standalone operating mode when you want to run just one {project_name} server instance. Standalone mode is useful when you need to test or play with of {project_name} features.

You must not use standalone mode in production, as you could introduce a single point of failure.  For example, if your standalone mode server goes down, users cannot log on to the server.

For standalone mode, all caches are localized and cannot be distributed to clustered deployments. If you require a clustered deployments configuration, you must be in domain mode.
