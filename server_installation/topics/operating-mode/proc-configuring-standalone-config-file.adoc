= Configuring the `standalone.xml` file

You can configure infrastructure-level aspects for {project_name}. These aspects are located in the `standalone.xml` file, which is specific to the application server that {project_name} originates.

Additionally, you configure the file for non-infrastructure aspects that are specific to {project_name} components.

[WARNING]
====
If the server is running, changes that you make to the`standalone.xml` file do not take effect and might be overwritten
by the server.  Instead, use the command line scripting or the web console of {appserver_name}.
====

.Procedure
. In the standalone operation mode, go the the directory containing the `standalone.xml` file:
+
[source]
