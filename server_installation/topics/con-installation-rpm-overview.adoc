=== Installing RH-SSO from an RPM

NOTE: With Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8, the term channel was replaced with the term repository. In these instructions only the term repository is used.

You must subscribe to both the {appserver_name} {appserver_version} and RH-SSO {project_versionDoc} repositories before you can install RH-SSO from an RPM.

NOTE: You cannot continue to receive upgrades to EAP RPMs but stop receiving updates for RH-SSO.
