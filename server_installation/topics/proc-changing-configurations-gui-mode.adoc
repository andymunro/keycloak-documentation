= Changing configuration using GUI mode

You can run the CLI in GUI mode.  

GUI mode launches a Swing application you can use to graphically view and edit the entire management model of a _running_ server.
GUI mode is especially useful when you need help formatting your CLI commands and learning about the options available.  The GUI can also retrieve server logs from a local or remote server.

. Start in GUI mode.

----
$ .../bin/jboss-cli.sh --gui
----
NOTE: To connect to a remote server, pass the `--connect` option. Use the --help option for more details.

. Scroll down to find the node `subsystem=keycloak-server`.  

. Right-click on the node and click `Explore subsystem=keycloak-server`.
+
The system displays a tab that shows only the keycloak-server subsystem.
