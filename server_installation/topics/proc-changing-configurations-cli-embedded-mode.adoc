= Changing configurations using CLI embedded mode
If you are on the same machine as your standalone server and you want to
issue commands while the server is not active, you can embed the server into the CLI and make
changes in a special mode that disallows incoming requests.  

. Execute the `embed-server` command with the config file you want to change.
